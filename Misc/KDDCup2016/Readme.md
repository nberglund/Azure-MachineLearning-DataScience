This folder has content for the KDD 2016 tutorial "Scalable Data Science with R, from Single Nodes to Spark Clusters".

## Tutorial Prerequisites
* Make sure your machine has an ssh client with port-forwarding capability. On Mac or Linux, simply run the ssh command in a terminal window.
On Windows, download [plink.exe](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/plink.exe)
from http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html.

## Connecting to the Tutorial Clusters in Microsoft Azure
* Command line to connect with ssh (Linux, Mac) - replace XXX with the number of your cluster
```bash
ssh -L localhost:8787:localhost:8787 remoteuser@r-server.kddXXX-ssh.azurehdinsight.net
```
* Command line to connect with plink.exe (Windows) - run the following commands in a Windows command prompt window - replace XXX with the number of your cluster
```bash
cd directory-containing-plink.exe
.\plink.exe -L localhost:8787:localhost:8787 remoteuser@r-server.kddXXX-ssh.azurehdinsight.net
```
* After connecting via the above command lines, open [http://localhost:8787/](http://localhost:8787/) in your web browser to connect to RStudio Server on the edge node of your cluster
